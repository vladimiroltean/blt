Bandwidth and Latency Tester
============================

Bandwidth and Latency Tester (BLT) is a web application for generating and
plotting iPerf and ping traffic.

TODO:

* Input data sanitization
* Drop-downs instead of input text fields, where possible
* Hovering should give information about required format
* Make iperf test duration "unlimited"
* Ping traffic
* Feedgnuplot correct parameters
* Out-of-band error communication via sse
* Understand the annoying "sse :: connection error" cause
* Stop all traffic when one error is detected
* Inform client of stopped traffic
* Upload SSH login keys
* Download test data (bandwidth, rtt) as report
* CSS for correct element placement in page
* Make HTTP listen port configurable using getopt
